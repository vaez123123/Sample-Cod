Sample codes related to my article with the subject "**Designing a scheduling decision support system for the skin pass line: A case study of the steel finishing line**".
The description of each folder is as follows:  
  1. **Constraints and Objectives Functions :** Some functions calculate objective functions and check sequence constraints, such as width jump constraint, capacity, select the best coil, and so on.  
  2. **Parameters and Variables :** Define variables and input parameters in the different classes  
  3. **Read and Write Data :** Read the input data from the steel company's database as a case study and write the algorithm's output in it.   
  4. **MainSkinPassModel.cs:** The main body of the algorithm
