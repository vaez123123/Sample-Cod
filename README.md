Sample codes related to my article with the subject "Designing a scheduling decision support system for the skin pass line: A case study of the steel finishing line"The description of each folder is as follows:
Constraints and Objectives Functions : 
Some functions calculate objective functions and check sequence constraints, such as width jump constraint, capacity, select the best coil, and so on.
Parameters and Variables :
Define variables and input parameters in the different classes
Read and Write Data : 
Read the input data from the steel company's database as a case study and write the algorithm's output in it. 
MainSkinPassModel.cs: 
The main body of the algorithm
